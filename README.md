# SerialNumberTool
The intent of this program is to connect to a list of devices and pull the raw inventory data while associating with hosname and IP address
Still need: 

1. some exception handling when can't connect to device

2. better way to quickly build host_list

3. seperate aaa credentials from program

4. Working main program to bring peices together
